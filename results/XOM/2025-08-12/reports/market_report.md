I am unable to retrieve the data from Yahoo Finance due to connection issues. I will proceed by selecting a set of indicators that would be useful for analyzing XOM, assuming I had the data.

**Selected Indicators and Rationale:**

1.  **close\_50\_sma:** To gauge the medium-term trend of XOM's stock price.
2.  **close\_200\_sma:** To understand the long-term trend and overall market sentiment towards XOM.
3.  **macd:** To identify potential trend changes and momentum shifts.
4.  **macds:** To provide trading signals based on MACD crossovers.
5.  **rsi:** To detect overbought or oversold conditions.
6.  **atr:** To measure the volatility of XOM's stock price, informing stop-loss placement and position sizing.
7.  **boll\_ub:** To identify potential overbought conditions or breakout zones.
8.  **boll\_lb:** To identify potential oversold conditions.

I need the historical data to provide a detailed analysis. I'm unable to get the data needed to proceed further. I'll provide the analysis that would be done with the requested indicators if I had the data.

**Anticipated Analysis (If Data Were Available):**

*   **Trend Analysis:** By comparing the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA, I would determine the prevailing trend. If the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA, it suggests an uptrend, and vice versa. Crossovers of these averages could signal trend reversals.
*   **Momentum Analysis:** The MACD and its signal line would be analyzed for crossovers, indicating potential buy or sell signals. Divergence between the MACD and price action could highlight weakening trends. RSI levels above 70 would suggest overbought conditions, while levels below 30 would indicate oversold conditions.
*   **Volatility Assessment:** The ATR would provide a measure of XOM's volatility. Higher ATR values would suggest larger price swings, while lower values would indicate calmer trading conditions. Bollinger Bands would provide a range of expected price movement, with breakouts above the upper band or below the lower band potentially signaling continuation or reversal patterns.
