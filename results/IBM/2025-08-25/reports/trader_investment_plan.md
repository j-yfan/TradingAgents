Based on the provided investment plan and my analysis, I will **SELL** all existing holdings of IBM stock. The Bear analyst's arguments regarding competitive pressures, slowing growth, and risk management are more persuasive. I will prioritize risk aversion and the lessons learned from past investment mistakes.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
