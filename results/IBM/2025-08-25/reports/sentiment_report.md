**Summary:**

The overall sentiment surrounding IBM during the week of August 18th-25th, 2025, was slightly bearish. Negative news regarding increased competition in the AI and hybrid cloud sectors, coupled with analyst downgrades, significantly impacted investor sentiment and resulted in a moderate decline in the stock price. The upcoming Q3 earnings call will be crucial for IBM to regain investor confidence and potentially reverse the bearish trend. The company's strategic response to the intensifying competition in the AI and cloud markets will be key to determining its future performance. The partnership announced in edge computing may represent a positive long-term strategy, but its short-term impact seems limited.
